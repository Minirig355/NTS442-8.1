Threat and Vuln Management
	Nessus
		Task 1 - Intro
		Task 2 - Install
			• Had to register for a code, nothing abnormal
			• Gave me a good reason to get my VMs working again, I typically do Ubuntu but I chose Kali for the distro this time
			• Registered with the code in my email and setup an acct with a long randomly generated passphrase
			• Server starts as a service and then connected back with https://localhost:8834 (or kali instead of localhost)
		Task 3 - Navigation and Scans
		Task 4 - Scanning!
		Task 5 - Scanning a Web Application

	--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--

	MITRE
		Task 1 - 
			• ATT&CK® (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
			• CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
			• ENGAGE (sorry, not a fancy acronym)
			• D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
			• AEP (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)
		Task 2 - 
			• TTP:
				Tactic		Adversaries goal/objective
				Technique	how they achieve it
				Procedure	how it's executed
		Task 3 - ATT&CK
			• Globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics & techniques
			• Used to be windows only, expanded to MacOS and Linux (No UNIX? Just UNIX-like systems?)
		Task 4 - CAR
			• A good way to find ways to detect TTPs listed in the ATT&CK framework, essentially improving threat detection
			• Has a browser plugin for searching quickly and conviently
		Task 5 - ENGAGE
			• The logical next step, MITRE ENGAGE is geared towards engaging adversaries:
				○ Cyber Denial - Preventing adversaries from continuing to exploit
				○ Cyber Deception - Planting red herrings for the adversary
		Task 6 - D3FEND
			• Detection, Denial and Disruption Framework Empowering Network DEFENSE
			• Essentially this is a resource of cybersecurity countermeasures
		Task 7 - AEP
			• ATT&CK Emulation Plans
				○ Public libary of adversary emulation plans contributed from CTID
			• CTID - Center of Threat-Informed Defense
				○ This is meant to research cyber threats (like APTs) and their TTPs to benefit all. Vendors include:
					- AttackIQ
					- Verizon
					- Microsoft
					- Red Canary
					- Splunk
		Task 8 - ATT&CK and Threat Intelligence
			• Info and TTPs attributed to adversaries to ascertain best defensive strategies

	Yara (Yet Another Ridiculous Acronym)
		Task 1 - Intro
			• Virustotal had a part in this!
		Task 2 - What is Yara?
			• A pattern-matching program
			• Can search for example the string Hello World! from print("Hello World!") across the system, like a MUCH more robust find
		Task 3 - Deploy
		Task 4 - Introduction to Yara Rules
			• Every rule must have a name and condition on creation
				○ yara <name> <dir>
		Task 5 - Expanding on Yara Rules
			• Some conditions:
				○ Desc			Description of the rule from the author
				○ Meta			Part of the file that doesn't influence the rule at all, good for the Desc
				○ Strings		As it says on the tin, strings to search for
				○ Conditions	Your typical conditions, can be used with operators
		Task 6 - Yara Modules
			• Works with Python PE, Cuckoo Sandbox and a few others
		Task 7 - Other tools and Yara
			• LOKI (open source indicator of compromise scanner)
			• THOR (Also IOC scanner, multi-platform)
			• FENRIR (bash script IOC scanner, fixed issues from THOR/LOKI)
			• YAYA (repository manager)
		Task 8 - Using LOKI and its Yara rule set
			• Basically I'm given a suspicious file from a coworker, I use Loki to detect whether it's malicious or not
			• I run a scan and see it gets picked up as a web shell, matching the rule strl
			• Scanning the second file shows that it's benign
		Task 9 - Creating Yara rules with yarGen
			• Now it's time to create a rule specifically to detect the web shell that has been identified in the other files
			• yarGen is a generator for Yara rules
				○ It essentially will find isolated strings in a file you feed it that aren't found in any goodware, essentially creating detection rule for that specific malware
					+ --excludegood
		Task 10 - Valhalla
			• Also created by Florian, along with almost every other Yara tool that's been covered
			• Basically a repository/feed of Yara rules that are searchable by a handful of useful params
		Task 11 - Conclusion

	Zero Logon
		Task 1 - The Zero Day Angle
			• Leverages flaw in MS-NRPC (Microsoft NetLogon Remote Protocol) cryptography to get the ciphertext
		Task 2 - Impacket Installation
			• This is installed and utilized via Python Virtual Environs
		Task 3 - The Proof of Concept
			• This task is a lengthy write-up of a PoC for a ZeroLogon python script, wayyyy too lengthy to include in brief notes summary, link is here for reference
				○ https://tryhackme.com/r/room/zer0logon -- Task 3.
			• Exploiting it is one thing, but now we need a way to exploit the machine further
				○ This is done by changing the password of a user over RDP, for this it'll be a null password but that won't always be the case
					- This is done via inserting a handful of lines of code that were deduced via reading microsoft docs for this exact (legit) situation (NetrServerPasswordSet2)
		Task 4 - Lab It Up!
			• Command to reset machine back to original state:
				- powershell.exe -c 'Reset-ComputerMachinePassword'
			• Command to pass the local admin hash with evil-winrm
				- evil-winrm -u Administrator -H <Local Admin Hash> -i <ip>

	OpenVAS
		Task 1 - Intro
			• OpenVAS is an endpoint and wepapp vuln scanner
		Task 2 - GVM Framework Architecture
			• OpenVAS is built off of GreenBone Vulnerability Management
		Task 3 - Installing OpenVAS
			• Can be run from Docker! Also avail in Kali respositories but can be a pain
		Task 4 - Initial Config
			• Test installation with a localhost scan
			• There's a setup wizard going over a quick setup
		Task 5 - Scanning Infrastructure
			• Create a new task with the blue '★' button
				○ While creating a new task, new scan targets can also be selected with the ★ icon next to the field
		Task 6 - Reporting and Continuous Monitoring
			• For this task we're given a report to analyze
			• We're also going over continuous monitoring (schedules, basically cronjobs/task scheduler)
				○ Do this by Config > Schedules, create the schedule and THEN assign task/scans to it.
			• There's also alerts (Config > Alerts) which is configured very similarly to the schedules, but with an 'alerts' field for new vuln detections, scan status, etc
		Task 7 - Practical Vulnerability Management

	MISP
		Task 1 - Overview
			• Malware Information Sharing Platform
		Task 2 - MISP Intro: Features and Terminologies
			• Open-source threat information platform that collects, stores and distributes IOCs to a community of trusted members
				○ Their communities are split between closed, semi-private and open communities depending on trust level
			• Threat info can be piped into a NIDS or SIEM
			• Uses:
				○ Malware Reverse Engineering
				○ Security Investigations
				○ Intelligence Analysis
				○ Law Enforcement
				○ Risk Analysis
				○ Fraud Analysis
			• Functionalities:
				○ IOC Database
				○ Automatic Correlation
				○ Data Sharing
				○ Import & Export Features
				○ Event Graph
				○ API
			• Useful terms:
				○ Events		- Collection of contextually linked info
				○ Attributes	- Data points related to an event
				○ Objects		- Custom attribute compositions
				○ Object Ref	- Relationships between objects
				○ Sightings		- Time-specific occurrences of data point/attributes
				○ Tags			- Labels for events/attributes
				○ Taxonomies	- Classification libraries are used to tag, classify and organize information
				○ Galaxies		- Knowledge base items used to label events/attributes
				○ Indictors		- Pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity
		Task 3 - Using the System
			• Here I get hands onto a MISP instance, getting acquainted with the dashboard
			• Event Creation - On a basic level events are a bunch of information pertaining to an incident/investigation, these can be shared locally with your org, or to varying levels of public.
			• I can add attributes and attachments to events, this can help wtih IDS detections and allow others to see reports and analyze files
		Task 4 - Feeds & Taxonomies
			• Feeds are almost like CVEs, they're distributed out to people in the communities so they can be aware of threats, analyze threats and correlate threats
			• Taxonomies in MISP are much like the classes under the same name relating to animals
				○ Listed under the Event Actions tab
			• Tags also work much like we're all familiar with from youtube, social media and the likes
		Task 5 - Scenario Event
